I will implement the logic to display the pet's photo for monthly clients in the detailed list of the KPI card.

Here is the plan:

1.  **Inject Photo URL in Metrics Calculation:**
    *   In `StatisticsDashboardModal.tsx`, inside the `metrics` useMemo hook, I will update the appointment processing loop.
    *   When an appointment is matched to a monthly client (either by ID or name fallback), I will copy the `photo_url` from the monthly client record to the appointment object (`apt.photo_url`).

2.  **Update KPICard Component:**
    *   I will modify the `KPICard` component in `StatisticsDashboardModal.tsx` to handle the display of the photo.
    *   Currently, it only renders initials. I will update it to conditionally render an `<img>` tag if `apt.photo_url` exists.
    *   I will add an `onError` handler to the image to fallback to the initials if the image fails to load.

This ensures that whenever a user expands a KPI card (like "Faturamento Hoje"), any appointment linked to a monthly client will show their photo instead of a generic placeholder.
