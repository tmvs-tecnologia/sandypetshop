I will modify `src/components/AppointmentCard.tsx` to implement the requested UI changes:

1.  **Remove Discount Display**: Delete the code rendering `- R$ 10,00 (Desc.)`.
2.  **Update Header Badge**: Replace the static "Mensalista" badge with a dynamic badge displaying the `service` name (e.g., "Banho & Tosa"), effectively moving the service prominence to the header for monthly clients.
3.  **Update Condominium Logic**: Modify the condominium display in the grid to always render, and specifically show "Banho & Tosa Fixo" when the value is empty or "Nenhum Condomínio".
4.  **Move WhatsApp Link**: Relocate the WhatsApp contact link from the bottom of the card into the main Info Grid for better grouping of contact details.
5.  **Review Buttons**: Ensure the action buttons (Edit, Delete, Complete) remain accessible and correctly styled in the footer.

I will then verify the file to ensure all changes are correctly applied.
