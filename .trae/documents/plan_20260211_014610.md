I will enhance the Financial Dashboard with dynamic charts and interactive KPI cards.

### 1. Dynamic Donut Chart (Service Distribution)
- **Goal:** Correctly categorize and color-code appointments into 3 specific categories:
  1. **Banho** (Blue - `#3b82f6`)
  2. **Banho & Tosa** (Pink - `#ec4899`)
  3. **Pet Móvel** (Purple - `#a855f7`) - Logic: Any appointment from the `pet_movel_appointments` table.
- **Interactivity:**
  - Update `SimpleDonutChart` to show the **quantity** (count) when a slice or legend item is clicked/hovered (tooltip or central text).
  - Ensure percentages are accurate based on the total count of these 3 categories.

### 2. Interactive KPI Cards with Expansion
- **Goal:** Make KPI cards clickable to reveal a detailed list of appointments contributing to that metric.
- **Design:**
  - Add `onClick` handler to `KPICard` to toggle an expanded state.
  - **Animation:** Use smooth transition for height/scale expansion.
  - **Content:**
    - Show a scrollable list (max 5 visible items, then scroll).
    - **List Item Layout:**
      - Pet Photo (if available) or Initials Placeholder.
      - Pet Name (Bold).
      - Service Name (Subtext).
      - Price (Right aligned, formatted).
- **Scope:** Apply this to "Faturamento Hoje", "Esta Semana", "Este Mês", and "Este Ano" cards.

### 3. Implementation Steps
1.  **Modify `StatisticsDashboardModal.tsx`**:
    - Update `metrics` calculation logic to correctly classify "Pet Móvel" based on the source table (`pet_movel_appointments`), not just the service string string.
    - Update `SimpleDonutChart` to handle click events and display counts.
    - Enhance `KPICard` to accept a `details` prop (array of appointments) and manage the expanded state/UI.
2.  **Refine Data Handling**: Ensure `rawData` separates store vs. mobile appointments clearly to feed the chart logic correctly.

### 4. Verification
- Verify chart colors match the request.
- Verify "Pet Móvel" category captures all mobile appointments.
- Verify card expansion works smoothly and displays the list as requested.
