I will redesign the **StatisticsDashboardModal** component to improve mobile usability and correct financial calculations as requested.

### 1. Layout & Design Changes
- **Mobile Experience**: 
  - Remove the Tab Navigation bar on mobile devices.
  - Render all dashboard sections (Overview, Financial, Operational) in a single vertical scrollable view on mobile (Stack layout).
  - Keep the Tab Navigation for Desktop (md+ screens) for better organization.
- **Header**: Remove the "Exportar Relatório" button.

### 2. Logic & Data Fixes
- **Timezone Correction**: Fix the "Today" calculation to strictly use Brazil/Local time (ignoring UTC offsets that cause "tomorrow" issues in the evening).
- **"Faturamento Hoje"**:
  - Ensure it calculates the sum of all *completed* appointments for the current calendar day (Local Time).
- **"Este Mês" Card**:
  - **Feature**: Add a Month Selector (Dropdown) inside the card.
  - **Logic**: Calculate the total of **Banho & Tosa** services (filtering by service name/type) marked as *completed* for the selected month.
- **"Este Ano" Card (formerly "Total 2026")**:
  - **Rename**: Change title to "Este Ano".
  - **Feature**: Add a Year Toggle (Previous/Next or Dropdown) to switch between 2025/2026.
  - **Logic**: Sum of all *completed* appointments for the selected year.
- **"Receita Diária" Graph**:
  - **Logic**: Display bars for the **Current Week** (Sunday to Saturday) instead of a rolling 7-day window.
  - **Data**: Sum of completed appointments for each specific day of the week.

### 3. Implementation Details
- I will modify `src/components/StatisticsDashboardModal.tsx`.
- I will introduce local state for `selectedMonth` and `selectedYear`.
- I will verify the "Banho & Tosa" filter ensures only relevant services are counted for that specific card.
