I will create a new, modern UI component for the "Banho & Tosa" appointment cards, matching the aesthetic of the "Mensalistas" cards as requested.

### 1. Create `src/components/AppointmentCard.tsx`
I will create a new React component that encapsulates the appointment card logic and styling.
- **Design System**: "Soft Modern" aesthetic with rounded corners (`rounded-3xl`), soft shadows (`shadow-sm`, `hover:shadow-xl`), and brand-aligned gradients (Pink/Purple).
- **Structure**:
  - **Header**: Gradient status bar, Pet Photo (with fallback and gradient blur effect), Pet Name, and Badges (Status, Mensalista, Responsável).
  - **Info Grid**: Organized layout for Owner, WhatsApp, Service, and Date/Time using Heroicons.
  - **Footer**: Price display (prominent), Extras badges, and Action Buttons (Edit, Delete, Complete) with improved touch targets and hover states.
- **Functionality**:
  - Encapsulate price calculation logic (including extra services and monthly discounts).
  - Handle all interactions (Edit, Delete, Complete, WhatsApp redirect).
  - Support "Mensalista" and "Responsável" logic.

### 2. Update `App.tsx`
I will modify the main application file to use the new component.
- Import `AppointmentCard`.
- Replace the existing inline `div` rendering loop with the `<AppointmentCard />` component.
- Pass necessary props (appointment data, handlers for actions).

### 3. Verification
- I will verify that the new card renders correctly with all data points.
- I will ensure all buttons and interactions (especially the Action Menu and WhatsApp link) continue to work as expected.
- I will check that the design matches the "Mensalistas" card reference.
