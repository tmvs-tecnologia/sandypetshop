I have identified the issue. The `handleUpdateStatus` function in `App.tsx` ignores the `price` argument passed to it, causing the webhook to send the original database price instead of the displayed calculated price.

**Plan:**
1.  Modify `handleUpdateStatus` in `App.tsx` to accept an optional 4th argument: `finalPrice?: number`.
2.  Update the webhook payload construction within `handleUpdateStatus` to use this `finalPrice` if provided, overriding the default price from the appointment object.
3.  This ensures that when "Concluir" is clicked, the price displayed in the UI (which includes extras and discounts) is the one sent to the webhook.
