I will implement the "Top 5" statistics logic as requested, ensuring it covers all historical data and calculates values correctly.

Here is the plan:

1.  **Include All Monthly Clients (Active & Inactive):**
    *   Currently, the system only loads *active* monthly clients (`is_active: true`).
    *   To satisfy the "since forever" (`desde sempre`) requirement, I will modify the query to fetch **all** monthly clients. This ensures that a top client who recently canceled their plan is still counted in the historical rankings.

2.  **Robust Appointment Matching (Hybrid Approach):**
    *   The current logic relies solely on matching `pet_name` + `owner_name`. This can fail if there are typos or name changes.
    *   I will implement a **Hybrid Matching Strategy**:
        1.  **Primary:** Check `monthly_client_id` in the appointment (most reliable).
        2.  **Fallback:** If ID is missing (older records), match by normalized `pet_name` + `owner_name`.

3.  **Data Verification:**
    *   Ensure the `price` summation handles numeric values correctly to prevent calculation errors.
    *   The "Top 5" logic for both "Completed Services" and "Investment" will remain based on the `CONCLUÍDO` status as requested.

This approach ensures the dashboard reflects the true "All-Time" history of your monthly plan customers.
