# Redesign Plan: Monthly Client Cards & Extra Services

## 1. Design Direction: "Friendly Modernism"
**Aesthetic Goal**: Create a warm, approachable, yet highly functional interface that elevates the "Pet Shop" experience beyond a utility tool. The design will focus on clarity, hierarchy, and delightful micro-interactions.

**Design Feasibility & Impact Index (DFII)**:
- **Impact (4/5)**: Distinctive use of soft gradients, rounded friendly shapes, and clear typography.
- **Fit (5/5)**: Perfectly aligns with the caring/playful nature of a Pet Shop.
- **Feasibility (5/5)**: Achievable with existing Tailwind stack.
- **Performance (5/5)**: CSS-driven animations, zero heavy runtime.
- **Consistency Risk (-1)**: May make older components look dated, but sets a new standard.
- **Total Score**: **18/20 (Strong/Excellent)**

**Design System Snapshot**:
- **Typography**: 
  - **Headings**: *Outfit* (Friendly, geometric sans-serif) - for pet names and prices.
  - **Body**: *Plus Jakarta Sans* (Legible, modern) - for details and labels.
- **Color Palette**:
  - **Primary**: Soft Pink/Purple Gradients (Brand alignment).
  - **Surface**: Pure White with soft diffuse shadows (`shadow-lg`, `shadow-pink-500/10`).
  - **Accents**: Distinct badges for Hotel (Blue), Daycare (Yellow), and Extras (Indigo).
- **Motion**:
  - **Cards**: `hover:scale-[1.02]` with spring-like bezier curves.
  - **Toggles**: Smooth background color transitions and knob slides.
  - **Feedback**: Pulse effects on important actions.

## 2. Technical Architecture
### Component Extraction & Restructuring
To improve maintainability and apply the new design cleanly, we will extract the monolithic component from `App.tsx`.

1.  **`src/components/MonthlyClientCard.tsx`**:
    - **New Component**: Extracted from `App.tsx`.
    - **Features**:
        - **Glassmorphic Header**: Gradient background with slight transparency/blur if possible, or clean solid gradient.
        - **Data Grid**: Reorganized info into clear "quick view" clusters (Pet, Service, Payment).
        - **Action Bar**: Floating or clearly separated action buttons with hover states.
        - **Responsive**: Grid changes from 1 column (mobile) to 2 columns (desktop) seamlessly.

2.  **`src/components/ExtraServicesSelection.tsx`**:
    - **New Component**: Replaces the list of checkboxes in `ExtraServicesModal`.
    - **UI**: "Selection Cards" layout. Each service is a clickable card with an icon, name, and toggle switch.
    - **Interaction**: Clicking anywhere on the card toggles it. Active state has a colored border and subtle background tint.

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Setup & Assets
- Add Google Fonts (Outfit & Plus Jakarta Sans) via a dynamic style tag or CSS import to ensure the "Non-generic" typography requirement.
- Define custom Tailwind classes for specific shadows and animations if needed (or use arbitrary values).

#### Step 2: Create `MonthlyClientCard`
- Implement the new visual design.
- **Key Visual Changes**:
    - Larger, centered Pet Photo with a "ring" status indicator.
    - "Price Tag" style display for the monthly fee.
    - Badges for Hotel/Daycare moved to a prominent top-right or below-name position.
    - "Extras" section redesigned from text list to a row of mini-icons/badges.

#### Step 3: Redesign Extras Selection (`ExtraServicesSelection`)
- Build a grid of interactive cards for services (Banho, Tosa, etc.).
- Use `framer-motion` (if allowed/installed) or CSS transitions for the toggle switch animation. *Note: Will use CSS transitions to avoid adding heavy dependencies unless requested.*
- Group services logically (General vs. Daycare) with clear section headers.

#### Step 4: Integrate & Refactor
- Replace the internal `MonthlyClientCard` in `App.tsx` with the imported one.
- Update `ExtraServicesModal` to render the new `ExtraServicesSelection` component.
- Ensure all props and event handlers (`onEdit`, `onDelete`, etc.) are correctly passed and typed.

#### Step 5: Verification
- **Visual Check**: Verify typography, spacing, and colors match the "Friendly Modernism" intent.
- **Responsive Check**: Test card layout on 320px (mobile) vs 1024px+ (desktop).
- **Functional Check**: Ensure toggling extras updates the price/state correctly and saving works.
- **Accessibility**: Verify contrast ratios and focus states for keyboard navigation.

## 3. Validation Strategy
- **Usability**: Check if the "Extras" selection is intuitive (click target size > 44px).
- **Performance**: Ensure no layout shifts when toggling options.
- **Code Quality**: Strict TypeScript typing and clean component interfaces.
